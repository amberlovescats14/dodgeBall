I am going to create three columns, signed up, players and blue team
Signed up needs a button that onClick, will move the Person, to Player. 
The Blue team column needs a blue button to move Players to their team.
To do this, I am going to start with a Person class.
Then I am going to extend Person with Values, to get their age and gender
I will also create a get function to post the values.
Then I am going to do the same for Blue team.
I might use a set function also..
Im not gonna use a API, Im just going to create the Persons, since there are only 6.
